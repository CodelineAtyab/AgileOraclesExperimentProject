When performing a code review, please make sure to consider the following:

1) The team is learning Java
2) There are team members not from computer science or programming background, so make sure examples relate to real world for better understanding
3) The code should be clean and well-structured, following best practices for Java development. For now keep a light hand on security and performance, as the team is still learning the basics of Java. Focus more on readability and maintainability of the code.
4) Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement, without sharing the example code. Just hints are good enough.
